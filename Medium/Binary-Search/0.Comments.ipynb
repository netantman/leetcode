    "The implementation of binary search is to maintain two pointers, `left` and `right`. At each iteration, calculate `mid=(left+right)//2` (note the integar division of `//`). The `while` loop continues when `left<right-1`, and will stop when `left==right-1`. Depending on the criteria set for `left` and `right`, either `left` or `right` should be what you search for."

    "- It helps to fully determine the meaning of `left` and `right` before starting, so that there is no ambuguity which one is the result when you stop.\n",
    "- Oftentimes, the harder part is to recognize to use binary search to optimize existing algorithm. A good hint is maybe it is the only algo that beats `O(n)` (it is `O(log n)`).\n",
    "- It may become more efficient when searching for a specific target in the array, to just return `left`, `right` or `mid` when it is equal.\n",
    "- It seems that in binary search, confusing idx and nums[idx] is a mistake you tend to make a lot.\n",
    "- Always remember to see the meaning of `left` or `right`, i.e. `left` is not applying to condition and `right` is, etc. It is possible that `left` or `right` does not fit the sterotype from the beginning."
