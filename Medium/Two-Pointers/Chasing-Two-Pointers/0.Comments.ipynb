    "The idea of chasing two pointers is to maintain a sliding window as described between the two pointers, enlarging (moving `right` pointer further to the right) or shrinking (moving `left` pointer further to the right) as needed. Since at most the two pointers traverse the whole array in iterations, it is `O(n)` and pretty efficient.\n",

    "- To figure out when a window should enlarge or shrink can be non-trivial. The key, as in other two-pointers problems, is to be very clear about what the window describes.\n",
    "- ~One edge case that may need to handle separately is when the right pointer has reached the end of the array: usually the time when the `while` loop is exited. In this case, the remaining window still need to be dealt with.~ This is not longer an issue with the template below.\n",
    "- ~Somehow relating to the point above, another thing to watch out for is index out of range.~ This is not longer an issue with the template below.\n",
    "- When shrinking the window, i.e. when left pointer moves right, be sure to check if window size has shrinked to 0, i.e. when `left==right`.\n",
    "- ~You are used to use `while` loop to implement this. Make sure at least one of the `left` or `right` pointers moves - otherwise you will have infinite `while` loop.~ This is no longer an issue with the template below.\n",
    "- Sometimes the `left` pointer needs to move to the end too; see Problem 1358.\n",
    "- Note that the **time complexity** of two-pointers are of $O(n)$: it only depends on the number of executions in the inner most loop, but not on how many loops there are.\n",
    "- The **space complexity** is $O(1)$: only those needed to allocate for the two pointer variables."
