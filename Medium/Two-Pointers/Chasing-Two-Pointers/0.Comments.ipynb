    "The idea of chasing two pointers is to maintain a sliding window as described between the two pointers, enlarging (moving `right` pointer further to the right) or shrinking (moving `left` pointer further to the right) as needed. Since at most the two pointers traverse the whole array in iterations, it is `O(n)` and pretty efficient.\n",

    "- To figure out when a window should enlarge or shrink can be non-trivial. The key, as in other two-pointers problems, is to be very clear about what the window describes.\n",
    "- One edge case that may need to handle separately is when the right pointer has reached the end of the array.\n",
    "- Somehow relating to the point above, another thing to watch out for is index out of range.\n",
    "- When shrinking the window, i.e. when left pointer moves right, be sure to check if window size has shrinked to 0, i.e. when `left==right`.\n",
    "- You are used to use `while` loop to implement this. Make sure at least one of the `left` or `right` pointers moves - otherwise you will have infinite `while` loop."
